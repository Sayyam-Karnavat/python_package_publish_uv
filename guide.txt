1. Initialize the entire project structure using uv command
    - uv init --package "PACKAGE_NAME"



2. Go to the directory "PACKAGE_NAME" which is created using above command
 - cd "PACKAGE_NAME"


3. Inside the "src/PACKAGE_NAME" folder we can create our python package function and import into "__init__.py"

 - For ex :- We have created calculator and server .py files.
    Then we can add the functions inside our files into __init__.py file

    Ex :-
    from .calculator import add , sub, mul , div
    from .server import create_app

    __all__ = ["add" , "sub" , "mul" , "div" ,"create_app"]




# Note :- We can add required python libraries using uv add "library_name" and it will be automatically added in pyproject toml and virtual environment which was created by "uv init" command
For ex. I have add "flask" package and when user installs our package then flask will be automatically installed



4. In pyporject.toml file we can change version(if republishing or adding new features) and specify python version required etc and other stuff.


5. Set the token created on pypi.org website using command
    1. $Env:UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"        # Provide token in string in double quotes
        - This command will temporarily store the token and as soon as powershell terminal is closed the env variabile will be removed
        (For this tutorial I used this method and it works well)
    
    2. [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN", "YOUR_TOKEN", "User") # "User" is keyword and environment variable is persistent for logged user in windows only


6. To build package of our project go inside your project directory where pyproject.toml file is located and hit the command 
     - uv build --no-sources

    
7. Publish the package
     - uv publish


8. Test your package
    - uv add or pip install your "PACKAGE" and invoke functions defined.
